I was known to be the kid who broke things apart to figure out 'howstuffworks' causing a great deal of exasperation to the ones around me. My pursuit to explore the building blocks of everyday objects eventually led me towards studying elementary particle physics. The challenge of extracting meaningful information from myriad collisions of subatomic particles and validating it against theory predictions keeps me busy for most of the time. For the rest, I dabble with current technological advances and history of science.  




I work on particle physics phenomenology focusing on bottom quark decays. In particular, I study the decays of bottom quark bound states which are produced copiously in experiments like Belle, Babar and LHCb. These decays play a very important role in our understanding of the Standard Model of elementary particles. My job is to analyze experimental signals of such bottom hadron decays using model-independent methods and look for footprints of physics beyond the Standard Model.
