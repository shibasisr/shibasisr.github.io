I work on particle physics phenomenology focusing on bottom quark decays. In particular, I study the decays of bottom quark bound states which are produced copiously in experiments like Belle, Babar and LHCb. These decays play a very important role in our understanding of the Standard Model of elementary particles. My job is to analyze experimental signals of such bottom hadron decays using model-independent methods and look for footprints of physics beyond the Standard Model.
